# 關於`淺我`
-------

Most of my experience is related to develop networking product, such as wireless router, xDSL gateway, GPON ONU, GEPON gateway and other embedded linux system devices. These devices are related to telecom and will use various chipset solutions, ex: Broadcom(Broadband, WiFi), Mediatek, Realtek, Intel Lantiq and etc. These chipset solutions will use different SDK architecture and proprietary libraries and utilities, so I need to design BSP architecture to make the system integration portable for different chipset solutions. My missions include system bring-up, minimize the modification of SDK for portable system integration, to design the BSP architecture for production, to develop customization and proprietary features for telecom. The customer's requests include router functions, firewall, QoS, web UI design and customization, VoIP development and integration, communication protocol with central office.
